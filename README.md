## About the Project

Hi, I'm Matheus ðŸ‘‹<br>
This is a special project for me, as it marks the beginning of my journey as a web developer.
It was created with the purpose of learning and applying the fundamentals of **HTML** and **CSS**, resulting in a simple and functional page that shares information about me.

> This project is a milestone in my learning and represents the beginning of my growth as a web page creator.
